        <h2>Purpose:</h2>
        <p>My personal website will serve as an online restaurant for people to order foods and ingredients. It will provide restaurant and interested individuals with  comprehensive opportunities to have series of networks and broad customer outreach.</p>

        <h2>Intended Audience:</h2>
        <p>The primary audience for my personal website includes chefs, transport, and customers seeking seeking food ordering and delivery services.</p>

        <h2>Rationale:</h2>
        <p>I have chosen this project as it aligns with the manageable scope of creating a three-page website within four weeks. The website will consist of a home page serving as a landing page and two child pages highlighting cart and explore page my work. Each page will have significant textual content, featuring details about foods, prices and contact information, along with relevant images. It will be hosted on GitHub and styled for a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.</p>

        <p>I will be using basic HTML and CSS to ensure that the website remains simple and informative in nature. This approach allows me to effectively present my qualifications and portfolio to potential employers and clients. This project combines the technical skills we've learned with practical use in creating a online restaurant that will be beneficial for my future career.</p>
